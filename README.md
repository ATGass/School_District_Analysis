# School District Analysis
## Overview
The idea behind this analysis is to understand school performance (math and reading scores) based on the different variables that might hurt or improve a school's performance. The variables that might affect performance include school size, budget, budget per student, and school type. We will break down the data by school and even grade level to best understand the scores for each school.
